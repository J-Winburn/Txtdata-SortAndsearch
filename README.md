# Database_Sort&Search
This project was part of the CS216 Software Engineering Techniques Class at The University of Kentucky

To run this program, you can use the following files

 This file contains 100,000 actors and actresses [actors.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18894764/actors.txt) 

 This file contains 1000 of Americas largest companies and thier revenue [fortune.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18894768/fortune.txt)

This file contains 80,000 of IMDb movies and their number of votes from the website [imdb.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18894769/imdb.txt)

Ive also included a makefile if you find that helpful.

|HOW TO RUN|

INPUT IS CASE SENSIITIVE

After having the required files, run make and then ./ the executable file as well as which txt file you want to sort, and the number of items you want to be sorted. The autocomplete feature allows you to type partial entrys, allowing you to type in things like "Wal" and Walmart, Walgreen, Walt-Disney, etc will auto fill after searching. 

Thank you for checking out this project!
